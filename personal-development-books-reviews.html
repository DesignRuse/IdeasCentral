						<h1>The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness</h1>
						<h3>by Morgan Housel</h3>
						<p class="p1">Morgan Housel's Psychology of Money teaches us how to think and act about money in a fundamental way. Many people become wealthy but lose it all within a short time. You can accumulate wealth even if you lack a formal degree by acting right.</p>
						<p class="p1">One should remember five important key points from the book...</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<svg class="icomoon">

							<li>
								<svg class="icomoon">

						<h1>Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds</h1>
						<h3>by David Goggins</h3>
						<p class="p1">David Goggins' childhood was a living nightmare, with poverty, bigotry, and physical abuse colouring his days and haunting his nights.</p>
						<p class="p1">David Goggins is one of the world's toughest people. He was abused as a youngster, both physically and emotionally, but instead of accepting his circumstances, he exploited them to propel him to greatness.</p>
						<p class="p1">Goggins wanted to join the Air Force, but when he looked in the mirror, all he saw was a child with limited physical and mental capabilities. He was suffering from toxic stress, which resulted in learning disabilities and significant social anxiety. Instead of accepting his situation, he opted to hold himself accountable using the mirror. He had lost 106 pounds in three months and was ready to face anything. </p>
						<p class="p1">Goggins wanted to show his trainers and coaches that he was prepared to go above and beyond their expectations. So he invented a technique known as the cookie jar to help him overcome these obstacles. The cookie jar reminds you of all the difficulties you've overcome in the past.</p>
						<p class="p1">According to Goggins, most persons barely use 40% of their potential. To become the superhero that he is, Goggins had to put in a lot of work and commitment. In 'Can't Hurt Me', he's designed a three-week challenge to help you reach your full potential. Lessons include coping with your brain's governor, embracing failure, and leveraging prior successes as a springboard for new endeavours.</p>

						<h1>The Courage To Be Disliked: How to free yourself, change your life and achieve real happiness</h1>
						<h3>by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga</h3>
						<p class="p1">To be content, one must be prepared to be disliked. When you have that courage, all of your interpersonal encounters will resemble one another. This book is based on the ideas of Alfred Adler, an Austrian doctor and psychologist. It teaches you how to make great life adjustments and achieve real happiness.</p>
						<p class="p1">There are three major takeaways from the book...</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<svg class="icomoon">
									<use xlink:href="resources/images/icon-sprite.svg#icon-check"></use>
								</svg>
								Your past does not determine your future, and all that is required is a willingness to change. The first step is to believe in the possibility of change.
							</li>
							<li>
								<svg class="icomoon">
									<use xlink:href="resources/images/icon-sprite.svg#icon-check"></use>
								</svg>
								Many of us focus on our flaws or lacks and blame them for where we are in life. Adler categorises all of these issues and flaws into two categories: objective and subjective. Objective things are those that can be measured and are objectively true. Subjective faults are those that people manufacture; they are not actual.
							</li>
							<li>
								<svg class="icomoon">
									<use xlink:href="resources/images/icon-sprite.svg#icon-check"></use>
								</svg>
								According to Adler, community should include every single person in the world. If you focus on yourself and treat others like partners and equals, you can achieve anything. You will be more happier in your life if you let go of that competitive, limited attitude and embrace the concept of plenty and the potential of achievement for everyone.

						<h1>Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know</h1>
						<h3>by Adam Grant</h3>
						<p class="p1">Adam Grant's book is meant for those who want to review themselves or society, as well as those who want to help others do so. Rethinking our beliefs may jeopardise our identities and cause us to feel as if we are losing a piece of ourselves. You should question what you believe you know, be curious about what you don't know, and adjust your opinions in light of new information. Think Again can help you become more knowledgeable, persuasive, and self-aware by highlighting the importance of being modest about what you don't know, how to recognize blind spots in your thinking before they cause issues, and what you can do to become more effective at persuading people of your point of view.</p>

							A mouse, a dog, and a human are all highly structured networks of millions and trillions of cells.
							According to Darwin's theory of evolution, living creatures acquire and pass on adaptations required for survival in a changing environment.
							Biologists are becoming aware that animals co-evolved and continue to cohabit with various assemblages of microbes essential for good health and development.
